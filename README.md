# PerseusROV
A DIY ROV running a headless version of Raspian on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. 

## Project Overview

The Perseus ROV platform was designed as an introductory vehicle to the world of underwater robotics. As a result, the project's software is written to be easily understood and modified, even by beginners. This means that a large portion of the project has been written in Python due to the language's natrual accessibility and ever increasing popularity. Additionally, since much to the project's computer interface happens within a web browser, HTML is also heavily employed.
